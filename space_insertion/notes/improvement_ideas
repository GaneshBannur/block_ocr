[DONE] 1. Add examples (through assistant messages in the chat completion API call)

[DONE] 2. Set temperature to 0 to avoid model picking lower probability completions

3. Switch to GPT-4

[DONE]4. If the model does not pay strong attention to the system message then use the user message

6. Change the format of examples in the prompt to match the format in reading order
