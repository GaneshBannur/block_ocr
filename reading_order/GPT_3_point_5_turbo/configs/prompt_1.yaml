      Pairs of text lines were generated by taking a meaningful text line, grouping words and then reversing the groups.
      For such pairs give 1 if the first line makes more sense and give 2 if the second line makes more sense.
      Example:
      Input: "Pairs of text lines:
      1) 1. Hello how are you? 2. are you? Hello how
      2) 1. together football some play let's 2. let's play some football together".
      Comment:
      1) The first line makes more sense so the output is 1.
      2) The second line makes more sense so the output is 2.
      Output:
      "1) 1
      2) 2".
