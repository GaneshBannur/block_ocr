## System
Give the best possible answer and nothing else. Always explain the reasoning behind your answers in detail.
## User
Give the best ordering of the following strings as a single string. Use bounding boxes given only it isn't possible to order using the meaning of the strings. Explain, in detail, the reasoning behind the order you give.
String: '''hello ''' Bounding Box: [[1 -7] [0 -16] [4 -7] [4 -16]]
String: '''how ''' Bounding Box: [[0 -6] [0 -10] [5 -6] [5 -11]]
String: '''are? ''' Bounding Box: [[0 0] [0 -5] [5 0] [5 -5]]

# Response
The best ordering of the given strings as a single string is: "how are? hello"

To determine the ordering, we need to consider the bounding boxes provided for each string. The bounding box represents the spatial extent of each string in terms of its position on a two-dimensional plane.

Let's analyze the bounding boxes for each string:

1. String: "hello"
   Bounding Box: [[1 -7] [0 -16] [4 -7] [4 -16]]

   The bounding box for "hello" has a higher y-coordinate value (-7) compared to the other strings. This indicates that it should be placed above the other strings. Additionally, the x-coordinate values for the bounding box suggest that "hello" should be placed after "how" since its x-coordinate range is greater.

2. String: "how"
   Bounding Box: [[0 -6] [0 -10] [5 -6] [5 -11]]

   The bounding box for "how" has a lower y-coordinate value (-6) compared to "hello" and "are?". This suggests that "how" should be placed below "hello" and "are?". The x-coordinate values for the bounding box indicate that "how" should be placed before "are?" since its x-coordinate range is smaller.

3. String: "are?"
   Bounding Box: [[0 0] [0 -5] [5 0] [5 -5]]

   The bounding box for "are?" has the highest y-coordinate value (0) among all the strings. This suggests that "are?" should be placed below "hello" and "how". The x-coordinate values for the bounding box indicate that "are?" should be placed after "how" since its x-coordinate range is greater.

Based on the analysis of the bounding boxes, the correct ordering is "how are? hello".
