Form the most meaningful sentence from the following strings if the strings are meaningful. Only if the strings are not meaningful use bounding boxes given and give the best ordering of the strings as a single string. Explain, in detail, the reasoning behind the answer you give.
String: '''great ''' Bounding Box: [[1 9] [0 0] [4 9] [4 0]]
String: '''is ''' Bounding Box: [[0 10] [0 6] [5 10] [5 5]]
String: '''this ''' Bounding Box: [[0 16] [0 11] [5 16] [5 11]]

# Response
The most meaningful sentence that can be formed from the given strings is "This is great." 

Reasoning:
- The string "great" has a bounding box of [[1 9] [0 0] [4 9] [4 0]], indicating that it starts at position (1,0) and ends at position (4,9).
- The string "is" has a bounding box of [[0 10] [0 6] [5 10] [5 5]], indicating that it starts at position (0,6) and ends at position (5,10).
- The string "this" has a bounding box of [[0 16] [0 11] [5 16] [5 11]], indicating that it starts at position (0,11) and ends at position (5,16).

By arranging the strings in the order "This is great," we can see that the bounding boxes align properly and form a coherent sentence. The word "this" starts at position (0,11) and ends at position (5,16), followed by the word "is" starting at position (0,6) and ending at position (5,10), and finally the word "great" starting at position (1,0) and ending at position (4,9). This arrangement creates a grammatically correct and meaningful sentence.
