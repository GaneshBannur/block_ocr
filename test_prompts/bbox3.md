Give the best possible answer and nothing else. Always explain the reasoning behind your answers in detail.
## User
Give the best ordering of the following strings as a single string. Use bounding boxes given only if it isn't possible to order using the meaning of the strings. Explain, in detail, the reasoning behind the order you give.
String: '''hello ''' Bounding Box: [[1 9] [0 0] [4 9] [4 0]]
String: '''how ''' Bounding Box: [[0 10] [0 6] [5 10] [5 5]]
String: '''are? ''' Bounding Box: [[0 16] [0 11] [5 16] [5 11]]

# Response
The best ordering of the given strings as a single string is: "hello how are?"

The reasoning behind this order is as follows:

1. "hello ": The bounding box for this string is [[1 9] [0 0] [4 9] [4 0]]. The string starts at position (1, 0) and ends at position (4, 9). Since there are no other strings that overlap with this bounding box, we can place "hello " at the beginning of the final string.

2. "how ": The bounding box for this string is [[0 10] [0 6] [5 10] [5 5]]. The string starts at position (0, 6) and ends at position (5, 10). Since there are no other strings that overlap with this bounding box, we can place "how " after "hello " in the final string.

3. "are? ": The bounding box for this string is [[0 16] [0 11] [5 16] [5 11]]. The string starts at position (0, 11) and ends at position (5, 16). Since there are no other strings that overlap with this bounding box, we can place "are? " after "how " in the final string.

By following this order, we ensure that each string is placed in the final string without any overlap or conflict with the other strings.
