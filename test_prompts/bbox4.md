Form the most meaningful sentence from the following strings. Use bounding boxes given only if it isn't possible to use the meaning of the strings. Explain, in detail, the reasoning behind the order you give.
String: '''hello ''' Bounding Box: [[1 9] [0 0] [4 9] [4 0]]
String: '''how ''' Bounding Box: [[0 10] [0 6] [5 10] [5 5]]
String: '''are? ''' Bounding Box: [[0 16] [0 11] [5 16] [5 11]]

# Response
Hello, how are? 

The reasoning behind this order is as follows:

1. "hello" is the first string because it is a common greeting and typically used at the beginning of a conversation. It sets the tone for a friendly interaction.

2. "how" is the second string because it is a question word that prompts the listener to provide information or engage in a conversation. It follows naturally after a greeting.

3. "are?" is the last string because it completes the sentence by forming a question about the listener's well-being. The question mark indicates that it is a question, and the word "are" is necessary for grammatical correctness.

The bounding boxes are not necessary to determine the order of the strings in this case because the meaning and context of the words themselves are sufficient.
